Welcome to CartInstall, a very uncreatively named GodMode9 fork for installing 3DS cartridge games directly to the SD.
This takes about 35% less time than the traditional method of converting the cartridge image to a CIA, then installing with a tool like FBI. This also eliminates the need to have twice the amount of space free on the SD compared to what the game will actually take up.
The only known drawback to installing cartridges this way is that the resulting installed titles will show as taking significantly less space on the SD in data management or FBI than they actually do. This does not hinder functionality in any way, but it is worth noting.
This tool requires that you are running Luma3DS version 8.0 or above.
Please insert a 3DS cartridge, then press B to exit viewing this message.
