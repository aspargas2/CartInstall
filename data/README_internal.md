Welcome to CartInstall, a very uncreatively named GodMode9 fork for installing 3DS cartridge games directly to the SD.
This takes about 50% less time than the traditional method of converting the cartridge image to a CIA, then installing with a tool like FBI. This also eliminates the need to have twice the amount of space free on the SD compared to what the game will actually take up.
If you encounter any issues during the use of this tool, please report them at https://github.com/aspargas2/CartInstall/issues.
Please insert a 3DS cartridge, then press B to exit viewing this message.
