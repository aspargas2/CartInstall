# CartInstall
An uncreatively named __[GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9)__ fork for installing 3DS cartridge games to the SD

## General Info
As stated above, this is merely a fork of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9). I played no part in the creation of any of GodMode9.
Installing cartridges to the SD this way bypasses the need to have 2 times as much space free as the game actually takes, and takes about 35% less time than the traditional method of converting the cartridge image to a cia, then installing that with FBI.
This tool is very far from being thouroughly tested, so if you encounter any problems, please submit them to the issue tracker.

## Usage
Download `cartInstall.firm` from the [releases page](https://github.com/aspargas2/CartInstall/releases) and run it with the chainloader of your choice.

This tool currently only officially works with SysNAND, but EmuNAND support is planned.

If you somehow manage to install this tool to your firm0, you should first give yourself a solid facepalm. Then put [safeb9sinstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/safeb9sinstaller/releases)'s `.firm` on the sd root as `iderped.firm` and [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases)'s `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` in a `boot9strap` folder on the sd root, and boot the console. You should be in safeb9sinstaller, you doofus.

## How to build this / developer info
Build `cartInstall.firm` by running `build.bat`. This requires [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool), [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [devkitARM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/) installed.
Simply running `make` will build a normal-looking GodMode9. There is no use to doing this, and some scripting may be broken.

For additional customization, you may choose the internal font by replacing `font_default.pbm` inside the `data` directory.
You may also hardcode the brightness by adding ` FIXED_BRIGHTNESS=x` to the end of line 2 in `build.bat`, whereas `x` is a value between 0...15.
